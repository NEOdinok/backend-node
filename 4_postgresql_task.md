# ðŸ“š PostgreSQL Database Design

- You need to **design a database** (describe entities, their attributes, and relationships between them).

- Business domain: **"User Identification"**.

- Users must complete identification after registration.

- To do this, they must provide minimum personal data: `full name` and `date of birth`.

- The user must also provide a `document number`.

- Documents can be different: `passport`, `INN`, `SNILS`, `visa`, `migration card`.
