# RabbitMQ

> **AMQP** - Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. Built **on top of TCP**.

**RabbitMQ** is a message broker that offers a flexible and reliable system for transmitting messages between systems.  
It supports the **AMQP protocol**.

**Distributed task processing** - meaning that distributed system processes messages by **publisher confirmations** that
RabbitMQ got the message and **consumer acknowledgements** that consumer got and processed the message.

### üß≠ RabbitMQ Workflow

- `assertExchange` ‚Üí create exchange
- `assertQueue` ‚Üí create queue
- `publish` ‚Üí send message to exchange with a routing key
- `consume` ‚Üí listen to messages from queue

`amqplib` - node js package for rabbitmq

## üß≠ Exchange Types

- **Direct** - (Default one) Routes to queue 
- **Topic** - Pattern match (`*.error`, `user.*`)
- **Fanout** - Broadcast to all queues
- **Headers** Match on custom headers instead of keys

## üîÅ Message Ordering

- ‚ùå **No by default**
- Messages in a **single queue** are delivered in order
- To ensure order: use **"one queue per consumer"** pattern. Each consumer processes messages from it's own queue

## üì° Channels in RabbitMQ

**Channels** are virtual connections inside a single TCP connection to the RabbitMQ.

- Created and managed using the AMQP protocol.
- Multiple channels can be opened per connection.
- Used to isolate different operations (e.g., publishing vs consuming) in the same connection.
- Lightweight and fast ‚Äì avoids the overhead of opening multiple TCP connections.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It's important to never share a channel between producers and consumers. Always create separate channels for each logical responsibility.

## üíæ Durable Messaging

| Option                                 | Behavior                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `deliveryMode: 1`                      | Non-persistent queue            |
| `deliveryMode: 2`                      | Message survives broker restart |
| `assertQueue(..., { durable: true })`  | Queue survives broker restart   |
| `assertQueue(..., { durable: false })` | Temporary queue                 |

> Durable messages `deliveryMode: 2` require durable queue to matter

## ‚úÖ Acknowledgements (At-Least-Once Delivery)

- **Manual ack**: `channel.ack(msg)`

  - Use for **critical operations** (e.g. orders, payments). Do the operation, then acknowledge
  - Set with: `{ noAck: false }` in `channel.consume(...)`

- **Auto ack**: `{ noAck: true }`

  - Use for **non-critical data** (e.g. logs, metrics)
  - Message is treated as handled immediately upon delivery

## üóÉÔ∏è RabbitMQ vs Kafka Persistence

**RabbitMQ**:

- Messages can be persisted with:
- `channel.assertQueue('q', { durable: true })`
- `channel.sendToQueue('q', Buffer.from(msg), { deliveryMode: 2 })`
- ‚ùå **Messages are deleted after delivery**
- Designed for **message passing**, not long-term storage

**Example:** Multiple workers consume tasks.

**Kafka**:

- Stores messages on disk for a **configurable retention period**
- ‚úÖ Consumers can **re-read** messages multiple times "Replayability"
- Designed for **event streaming** and **log storage**.

**Example:** Frontend sends events to analytics.

## üß± Role of Queues in Server Architecture

1. **Load Balancing Among Handlers**

   - Distribute tasks across multiple workers
   - Add more consumers to scale under high load

2. **Message Buffering for Resilience**

   - Queue stores incoming messages if handlers are slow/unavailable
   - Prevents message loss during spikes or failures

3. **Ordered & Reliable Processing**

   - Ensures messages are processed **in the order sent**
   - Combined with **acknowledgements**, guarantees reliability

## Smart broker dumb consumer

- `RabbitMQ` is smart broker
- In `RabbitMQ` the **broker (server)** manages all the logic for delivery, routing, and ordering of messages
- **Consumer (client)** only processes and acknowledgments messages.
- **Simplifies client code**, **reduces the load** on the consumer.

## RabbitMQ entities

## RabbitMQ Core Entities

- **Exchange**  
  Think of an exchange like a post office sorter: it receives every incoming message and, based on rules, decides which queue(s) should get it.

- **Queue**  
  A queue is like your home mailbox: messages sit here until a consumer (you) comes by and picks them up.

- **Binding**  
  A binding is the address label that links an exchange to a queue. It tells the exchange, ‚ÄúIf a message matches this pattern, deliver it to that queue.‚Äù

- **Virtual Host (vhost)**  
  A virtual host is like an apartment building with separate mailrooms: it provides isolated namespaces so multiple apps can use the same RabbitMQ server without stepping on each other‚Äôs messages.

- **Connection**  
  A connection is the TCP ‚Äúphone line‚Äù between your application and the RabbitMQ broker. You usually open one per application instance.

- **Channel**  
  A channel is like an individual phone call on that line: it‚Äôs a lightweight, multiplexed session over a single connection. Best practice is to do most operations over channels rather than opening many connections.

- **Message**  
  The actual letter you send: it carries a payload (body) and optional metadata (headers, routing key, TTL). Exchanges and queues handle messages.

- **User & Permission**  
  Users are like people with mailroom keys, and permissions control which vhosts/exchanges/queues they can access.

- **Policy**  
  Policies let you apply configuration (e.g., TTL, mirroring) across many queues or exchanges at once‚Äîlike building codes that apply to all apartments on a floor.

## Delivery semantics
- at-least-once
- at-most-once
- exactly-once (tricky)

## ‚öîÔ∏è RabbitMQ vs Kafka

> üí° In *Kafka* **Offset** = the unique, incremental position number of each message inside a Kafka **partition**.
> üí° Kafka **topic** (which you might think of as ‚Äúa queue‚Äù) is split into multiple **partitions** for scalability and parallelism.

**Kafka** looks like this:

```sql
Topic: payments
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Partition 0:  offset 0 1 2 3 4 ...
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Partition 1:  offset 0 1 2 3 4 ...
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Partition 2:  offset 0 1 2 3 4 ...

```

| **Delivery**      | **At-Least-Once** (with acknowledgments) by default. At-most-once (by disabling acks). Exactly-once is complex and requires application-level logic. | **At-Least-Once** by default. Exactly-once achievable with Kafka Transactions. At-most-once by committing offsets before processing. |
| **Message Routing** | **Rich routing capabilities** via various Exchange types (Direct, Topic, Fanout, Headers). Built-in Fanout Exchange for broadcast. | Primarily **topic-based partitioning**. Fanout/broadcast achieved by multiple consumer groups subscribing to the same topic. |
| **Use Case**      | **Traditional message queuing**, task queues, complex routing. | **Event streaming**, log aggregation, real-time analytics, big data ingestion. |

## RabbitMQ usage example on a project:

```plaintext
RabbitMQ is a message broker that offers a flexible and reliable system for transmitting some messages between systems.
It supports the AMQP protocol. Also Rabbit enables distributed message or task processing, which is very beneficial in a microservices architecture like our online store.

In my project, there was a product service and an order service. Under normal circumstances, both services interacted with
other services via an API Gateway. However, in certain situations, such as checking product availability when
placing an order, my order service would directly send an HTTP request to the product service.
And actually this is where Rabbit came into play.

To improve architecture and avoid direct dependencies between microservices, we implemented Rabbit.
We used the concept of "exchanges" and "queues" in Rabbit to control how messages are transmitted.
So when the "Orders" service receives a new order, it sends a message with order information to an exchange (like product ID).
The exchange routes this message to a queue listened to by the "Products" service.

Once the "Products" service receives a message, it checks product availability. After checking, it sends a message
(like availability or lack thereof) back to another exchange which connected to a queue that the "Orders" service listens to.
And the main advantage of using RabbitMQ in this scenario is that interaction between services becomes completely asynchronous.
That is, services don't block while waiting for a response from another service. Moreover, using RabbitMQ ensures reliability,
as even if one of the services fails, messages aren't lost; they remain in the queue until they are successfully processed.
```
