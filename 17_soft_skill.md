## ETG Experience (Booking Service)

Over the past 3 years at ETG, London, I worked on a global flight booking system used **in more than 100+ countries**.
We are a very high load service processing over **250k** active users per month.

Worked in **two teams:**

- **so-called Extraneet** team responsible personal account for hotel owners
- **Discovery team** responsible for core search and reservation business logic.

Led the **Hybrid Rate feature**, which generated **$1.8M in new revenue within 3 months**.  
Personal account page contained lots of wizards and forms which my team got tired or building by hand.  
This is how i came to idea of a declarative form generator which simplified form-related work
and optimized CI/CD pipelines, **cutting release times by 75%.**

I designed **core booking and search services**, improving **system stability and user experience as a result**.  
Implemented `tag-based` filtering and ranking system functionality that boosted search result relevance and user return rates up almost **50%**;

## Geeks Ltd

`Prometheus` and `Sentry` for real time monitoring.
Reduced error detection time **from 50 to 11 minutes**, spent lot of time onboarding newcomers, wrote documentation, conducted
one-on-one meetings and as a result shortened onboarding time from 90 to 30 days.

I’m looking for a strong engineering team and impactful product. Happy to connect with the team as soon as possible.
